# Highfleet Ship Manager

This tool was created to organise ship downloads for the Highfleet community.

Ships can be submitted to be included in the [HighfleetShipRepository](https://github.com/MaxWasUnavailable/HighfleetShipRepository), via which they will be accessible in the Ship Manager.

You can specify additional repositories through the [config.yaml](https://github.com/MaxWasUnavailable/HighfleetShipManager/blob/master/data/config.yaml) file.


### How to run:

For now, you'll need to install Python 3.9 and the project's requirements (as specified in the requirements.txt).

After this is done, simply execute the `run.py` file through Python.
